# PILE FANSITE
This website has been designed to create band awareness for PILE and give fans a place to come and easily find out if there are any news updates, new material or opportunities to watch them perform. As well as links to their other social and audio platforms to listen to their music, watch their music videos or follow them directly, with means to contact them in a variety of ways if they wish.

## Features
<!--In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.-->

### Existing Features
### - Navigation Bar

- The navigation bar is featured at the top, in the header of all four pages within the site, and is fixed to enable users to easily navigate through the website at all times and creates continuity, without having to rely upon the 'back' button to navigate through the pages. 
- On the left of the header is the name of the band in big bold font, this is always visible and when clicked will return the user back to the home page. On the right hand side, are the headings and links to the other pages within the website. The page that the user is currently on is highlighted by being underlined. 
![Screenshot of the navigation bar, sitiuated in the header of the webpage. On the left is the bands name written in large. On the right is a list of the other page headings, (home, music, tour, contact) which represent the links ot their respective pages. Home is underlined as it is the page which is currently being viewed.][navbar]

- On mobile phone devices the navigation section is within a drop down toggle, to maximise space, the user will need to click on the icon of a record which is the same as the favicon in the tab, to enable it to drop down and select which page they wish to view.
![Screenshot of the same navigation bar but on a mobile device. The list of page headings is only revealed once the user clicks on the record icon in the header at the top left and then the list comes down vertically][nav-toggle]
 
### - The Landing Image
- There is a large, eye catching image of the band visible at the top of the landing page, which introduces the user to them and grabs their attention before viewing the rest of the content available.

### - Updates Section
- This section is a space to display any messages or news about the band. Each update has the date, some text and often an image or video files, showing new released content. 
- There are links between the updates on the home page to the other pages where relevent. There is a poster of the upcoming tour dates and a link of the post to the tour page, where people can see the dates more clearly and click a link to purchase a ticket. On the post about a new release coming out, there is a hyperlink to the album for users to check out the rest of the album, where they can view the album cover, track list and visit a link to the bands spotify to hear the album. 
- This is great for the user because it will keep them coming back to the site, to check if there are any new updates.
- Responsive design has been used for different devices to organise the content so that it flows better. On smaller screens the items are one on top of each other. Whereas on larger screens, the updates are larger, staggered and there is more padding to reduce the amount of negative space.

Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery and Sign Up page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
