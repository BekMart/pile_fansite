# PILE FANSITE
This website has been designed to create band awareness for PILE and give fans a place to come and easily find out if there are any news updates, new material or opportunities to watch them perform. As well as links to their other social and audio platforms to listen to their music, watch their music videos or follow them directly, with means to contact them in a variety of ways if they wish.

## Features
<!--In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
Screenshots and explainations of each of the main features and sections of the page. What it does. Why its their.-->

### Existing Features
### - Navigation Bar

- The navigation bar is featured at the top, in the header of all four pages within the site, and is fixed to enable users to easily navigate through the website at all times and creates continuity, without having to rely upon the 'back' button to navigate through the pages. 
- On the left of the header is the name of the band in big bold font, this is always visible and when clicked will return the user back to the home page. On the right hand side, are the headings and links to the other pages within the website. The page that the user is currently on is highlighted by being underlined. 
- On mobile phone devices the navigation section is within a drop down toggle, to maximise space, the user will need to click on the icon of a record which is the same as the favicon in the tab, to enable it to drop down and select which page they wish to view.
![Screenshot of the navigation bar, sitiuated in the header of the webpage. On the left is the bands name written in large. On the right is a list of the other page headings, (home, music, tour, contact) which represent the links ot their respective pages. Home is underlined as it is the page which is currently being viewed.][navbar]
 
### - The Landing Image
- There is a large, eye catching image of the band visible at the top of the landing page, which introduces the user to them and grabs their attention before viewing the rest of the content available. 

![Image of the band which is at the top of the landing page. It is a dark image of the three band members standing side by side which spans the wiodth of the page.][hero-image]

### - Updates Section
- This section is a space to display any messages or news about the band. Each update has the date, some text and often an image or video file, advertising new released content. 
- There are iframe videos of music videos that have been released. The user can click to view the video in the page, they can control the play and volume settings, enlarge it to watch in full screen or watch it via YouTube where it has been sourced from. 
- There are links between the updates on the home page to the other pages where relevent. There is a poster of the upcoming tour dates and a link to the tour page, where people can see the dates more clearly and click a link to purchase a ticket. On the post about a new release coming out, there is a hyperlink to the album for users to check out the rest of the album; they can view the album cover, track list and visit a link to the bands spotify to hear the specific album. 
- This is great for the user because it will keep them coming back to the site, to check if there are any new updates.
- Responsive design has been used for different devices to organise the content so that it flows better. On smaller screens the items are one on top of each other. Whereas on larger screens, the updates are larger, staggered and there is more padding to reduce the amount of negative space.  

![Image of the updates section, showing a heading, placed inside a fieldset. The latest update is at the top, showing the date posted, a small amount of text stating that the band are doing a US tour, with a link to the tour page and an image of a tour poster][update-screen]

### - Band Member Images
- This section is an image of each of the band members, playing on stage with their names over their picture. This tells the user who is who in the band. They can now put a face to a name and an instrument, just by viewing some eye catching images. 
- The images change throughout the responisve design. On a mobile device they are stacked in a column. In tablet sized devices they are staggered, and on larger devices like desktops, they are lined up horizontally. I have created this effect by using relative and absolute positioning as well as flex. 

![Screenshot of the band member pics horizontally in the desktop format. The first image is of Rick on stage, shouting into a microphone, holding a guitar with a keyboard in front of him. In the middle is a picture of Alex playing a yellow base guitar and a keyboard. The last of the three images is of Kris playing the drums. In the top left corner of each of the images is their names in large white font ontop of a dark background.][band-member-screen]

### - The Footer
- The footer is featured at the bottom of each page. In the centre at the top is a copyright message, followed by the name of the author. Underneath are links to their five maain social media links which are all represented by their well-known logos. When clicked, the icons will take you to the bands associated social media pages or audio platforms.  
- The social media links are evenly spaced along the bottom of the pages on all sized devices by using flex. 

![Screenshot of the footer. At the top in the centre it says Copyright 2024. Directly underneath it says the authors name; BekMart. Spread out evenly underneath this are the bands main social media links, which are represented by their well-known logos.][footer-screen]

### - The Music Page
- This page lists the band's music catalogue. It is split into two sections; 'Albums' and 'Other Releases' and the content is in order of their release date, with the most recent at the top. Each album has the album cover displayed, with the title in bold underneath and the details of the record label who produced the album and the release date. There is also a list of the tracks on the album and a clearly labelled link to the specific album on spotify where the user can listen to the album. 
- This page is responsive on all devices. On smaller screens, the album details and track list are underneath the album cover, but on larger screens the album information is adjascent to the album cover, on the right hand side.

![Screenshot of the music page. There is a heading at the top; 'Albums' which is decorated with lines above and underneath. The album cover is on the left hand side of the screen, taking up half of the page. The name of the album, the record label and date of release are detailed o the right hand side of the image, in the center of the negative space. To the right of this space is the track list and underneath that is a large button to click which will take the user to a new screen to listen to the album on spotify][music-screen]

### - The Tour Page
- This page details any upcoming events that the band are performing. It clearly states in a table format the date, venue and a link to purchase tickets form another site, which will open in a seperate window. 
- As the band do not currently have any upcoming events, I have just linked the tickets buttons to a ticket website, which usually sells their event tickets when they are available. 

![Screenshot of the top of the Tour Page. The page title is in the centre of the fieldset box. Inside this there are three headings at the top of the page which are defined by being in bold and decorated with lines over and underneath (date, venue, tickets). Listed underneath these headings are the relevant details. Underneath the tickets heading are large, bold, identical buttons, which when clicked take you to a website to purchase a ticket to that particular event][tour-screen]

### - The Contact Page
- The contact page is formed of two sections. The follow section and the newsletter section, the headings are displayed in bold with lines over and underneath, in unison with the previous pages. 
- The follow section is a list of nine links to the bands social media and audio platforms. The links are all set out in boxes, with the name of the website the user will be directed to clearly labelled in it. Once clicked the targetted website will open in a new window for the user to browse. 
- The boxes are all arranged on the page through responsive design using flex. 

![Screenshot of the follow section within the contacts page. A heading of Contact is in the top, centre of the fieldset box. Underneath this is a heading of follow which is bold and decorated with lines over and underneath. There is a grid effect of nine boxes with the name of social media and audio platforms in them in rows and columns of 3 in the centre of the section][contact-screen]

- The newsletter heading is decorated in the same way as the follow heading and is located underneath this section. 
- There is a form for the user to complete to subscribe to a newsletter. There are three entry points which are clearly labelled and easy to use (First name, last name, email address). 
- The subscribe button is clearly underneath the data entry points. 
- If any information is not completed in the correct format then there will be some feedback to tell the user that this hasn't worked and indicate why to encourage the user to complete the form correctly.
- This section is responsive on all devices. 

![Screenshot of newsletter section on contacts page. The newsletter heading is bold and decorated with lines above and underneath, consistent with other headings. There is a simple form to complete by filling in your first name, surname and email address and then a subscribe button to submit the request. This is all in the centre of the section at the bottom of the contacts page][subscribe-screen]

### Features Left To Implement
### - Merchandise Page
- If I had more time, knowledge and a higher skill-sets then I would like to have added a merchandise page to this website. 
- This would have involved going through payment authentication which is out of my current remit. 
- This would add value to the page, as the user would be able to browse and purchase audio products or apparel from one place. 

## Testing
- I tested that this webpage works in both Chrome and Safari. Everything worked perfectly fine on Chrome, however the Apple music links wont work in Safari.
- I confirm that all pages on this website are responsive and look good on all standard sized screens, using the devtools device toolbar. 
- The content of all the pages is readable, consistent in layout and easy to use intuitivaly. I have used consistent and contrasting colours throughout the website. Each page has a similar layout with the page title in the top centre of the fieldset box and any further headings in the same style. All links are clearly labelled and visible. 
- All of the functions work as expected. All links go to the correct place and open in seperate windows if the destination is a different website. The music videos play when the user clicks on them and they are able to control the volume, mute, pause or view on full screen. The form in the contact section works as intended, the user must complete each field correctly, otherwise an indicator will show what they have missed/completed incorrectly. Once submitted a webpage is shown with a table containing the information that has been recorded via a CI website.  
<!--How did I test the sites functionality. Different browsers. responsive on all screen sizes. each section is readable and easy to use. All functions work.
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.-->

Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
### Bugs

What bugs I found and how i fixed them. Are any bugs still there?

## Deployment
