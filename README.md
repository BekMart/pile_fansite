# PILE FANSITE
# User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

![Screenshot of my website displayed on several different sized device screens, using a web app called 'Am I Responsive', showing that my website has been adapted to look good on all devices.][responsive]

This website has been designed to create band awareness for PILE and give users a place to come and easily discover their back catalogue and any current information about the band, including where to watch them perform and links to several of their social media and audio platforms. 

This project is for educational purposes. The main aim is to build a responsive website with HTML and CSS only.

[Back to Contents](#contents)
<hr>

<h1 id="features">Features</h1>
The website consists of six pages:
- Four html pages which are accessible from the navigation menu.
- A 404 error page, which displays when the url has been entered incorrectly, with a link back to the home page.
- A submission confirmation page for when the form is successfully completed.

The website contains the following features:

## Navigation Bar

- The navigation bar is featured at the top, in the header of all associated pages within the site. 
- It is fixed to enable users to easily navigate through the website at all times and creates continuity, without having to rely upon the 'back' button.
- The navigation bar adapts to mobile devices by changing into a drop-down menu. The user will click on the icon of a record, to activate the drop down list and select which page they wish to view.

### Navigation layout:

- On the left hand side is the name of the band in big bold font, this is always visible and when clicked will return the user back to the home page. 
- On the right, are the headings and links to the other pages within the website. It contains:
    - Home
    - Music
    - Tour
    - Contact
- The page that the user is currently on is highlighted with an underline, so the user knows where they are within the website.

![Screenshot of the navigation bar, sitiuated in the header of the webpage. On the left is the bands name written in large. On the right is a list of the other page headings, (home, music, tour, contact) which represent the links ot their respective pages. Home is underlined as it is the page which is currently being viewed.][navbar]

## The Footer

- The footer is featured at the bottom of each page and has the same layout on all devices.
- In the centre at the top is a copyright message, followed by the name of the author of the website; BekMart. 
- Underneath are links to PILE's five main social media or audio platforms which are all represented by their well-known logos. 

![Screenshot of the footer. At the top in the centre it says Copyright 2024. Directly underneath it says the authors name; BekMart. Spread out evenly underneath this are the bands main social media links, which are represented by their well-known logos. (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Spotify, Apple Music)][footer]

## Home
 
## The Landing Image

- There is a large, striking image of the three members of PILE visible at the top of the landing page, which introduces the user to the band and grabs their attention before viewing the rest of the content available. 

![Image of the band which is at the top of the landing page. It is a dark image of the three band members standing side by side which spans the width of the page.][hero]

## Updates Section

- This section is a space to display any messages or news about the band. 
- Each update has the date, some text and an image or video file, advertising newly released content. 
- This section will enable the user to feel up to date with any current affairs relating to the band, compelling them to return regularly to check for more posts. 
- New releases of music videos are displayed for the user to watch. PILE produce very abstract music videos which are aesthetically appealing, adding an attractive element to the page and drawing in the user.
- There are links between the updates on the home page to other pages where relevent, to further assists the user in navigating fluently through the website. 


![Image of the updates section, showing a heading, placed inside a fieldset. The latest update is at the top, showing the date posted, a small amount of text stating that the band are doing a US tour, with a link to the tour page and an image of a tour poster. On the right hand side is another post of an album cover which has just been released, with a link to the album in the music page. This is also dated with a short explaination of what the post is showing.][updates]

## Band Member Images

- Images of each of the band members, playing on stage with their names over their picture. 
- This tells the user instantly who is who in the band, enabling them to put a face to a name and an instrument, just by viewing some eye catching images of the band in action. 

![Screenshot of the band member pics horizontally in the desktop format. The first image is of Rick on stage, shouting into a microphone, holding a guitar with a keyboard in front of him. In the middle is a picture of Alex playing a yellow base guitar and a keyboard. The last of the three images is of Kris playing the drums. In the top left corner of each of the images is their names in large white font on dark backgrounds.][band-members]

## Music 

- The Music page lists PILE's complete music catalogue. It is split into two sections; 'Albums' and 'Other Releases'. The contents is in order of their release date, with the most recent at the top. 
- Each item in the sections has the cover artwork displayed, with the title in bold, the details of the record label who produced the audio, the release date and the tracklist. 
- The artwork is displayed big and bold as the images are abstract and alluring, giving the page a pleasent feel, encouraging the user to continue browisng the website. 
- A bold link labelled 'listen' is clearly situated underneath each of the track lists, directing the user to the band's Spotify page, to the specific album they have chosen to listen to.
- After viewing this page, the user will know all of PILE's audio collection, and have access to their tracks directly via this page. 

![Screenshot of the music page. There is a heading at the top; 'Albums' which is decorated with lines above and underneath. The album cover is on the left hand side of the screen, taking up half of the page. The name of the album, the record label and date of release are detailed to the right hand side of the image in the center of the negative space. To the right of this space is the track list which is splitt into two columns and underneath that is a large button to click which will take the user to a new screen to listen to the album on spotify][music]

## Tour 

- The Tour page details any upcoming events that the band are performing. 
- It clearly states in a table format the date, venue and a link to purchase tickets from another site.
- Users will come to this page to see when and where the band are playing, they can choose the most suitable event for them and easily be led to a page to purchase a ticket. 
- It takes any hassle away from searching through ticket vendor sites, as this is tailored towards PILE events only.  
- As PILE do not currently have any upcoming events, I have linked the tickets buttons to a ticket website, which usually sells their event tickets when they are available. 

![Screenshot of the top of the Tour Page. The page title is in the centre of the fieldset box. Inside this there are three headings at the top of the page which are defined by being in bold and decorated with lines over and underneath (date, venue, tickets). Listed underneath these headings are the relevant details. Underneath the tickets heading are large, bold, identical buttons, which when clicked take you to a website to purchase a ticket to that particular event][tour]

## Contact 

The contact page is formed of two sections; the follow section and the newsletter section. 

## Follow

- This section hosts a list of nine links to the bands social media and audio platforms. 
- The links are all set out in boxes, with the name of the website the user will be directed to clearly labelled in it. 

![Screenshot of the follow section within the contacts page. A heading of Contact is in the top, centre of the fieldset box. Underneath this is a heading of follow which is bold and decorated with lines over and underneath. There is a grid effect of nine boxes with the name of social media and audio platforms in them in rows and columns of 3 in the centre of the section][follow]

## Newsletter

- There is a simple form for the user to complete to subscribe to a newsletter.
- There are three entry points which are clearly labelled, with the subscribe button underneath. 

![Screenshot of newsletter section on contacts page. The newsletter heading is bold and decorated with lines above and underneath, consistent with other headings. There is a simple form to complete by filling in first name, surname and email address. A subscribe button is located underneath to submit the request. This is all in the centre of the section at the bottom of the contacts page][newsletter]

## Success page

- Once the subscription form has been completed correctly, the success page will appear, with a message thanking the user for supporting the band and ensuring them that they will recieve future newsletters. 
- This gives the user piece of mind that their details have been acknowledged and logged correctly. 

![Screenshot of the success page. There is a heading saying thank you and a message 'You have been added to our mailing list! We will email you any future newsletters. Thank you for your support and keep listening!' followed by a thumbs up icon][success]

## 404 error page

- If the url is entered incorrectly then a 404 error message will appear. 
- This tells the user that the web address they have entered is incorrect, but offers them a link back to the home page and includes the navigation bar, to get to whichever part of the website they are specifically looking for. 

![Screenshot of a 404 error page. There is a heading saying 'page not found', followed by a no entry symbol and a message 'Sorry, the page you are looking for cannot be found. Please check the address and try again or return to the home page here.' The word here is underlined and when clicked, takes the user to the websites landing page][404]

# Features Left To Implement

## Merchandise Page

- If I had more time, knowledge and a higher skill-set, then I would like to have added a merchandise page to this website. 
- This would have involved going through payment authentication which is out of my current remit. 
- This would add value to the page, as the user would be able to browse and purchase audio products or apparel from one place.

<h1 id="testing">Testing</h1>

<h2 id="functionality">Functionality testing</h2>
 
- I can confirm that all the functions work as expected: 
    - All links go to the correct place and open in seperate windows if the destination is a different website, thus the user will still have access to this website via the existing open tab and can return easily to maximise user exposure. 
    - The music videos play when the user clicks on them and they are able to control the volume, mute, pause, view on full screen or view via YouTube, where the video is sourced from. 
    - The form in the newsletter section works as intended. 
        - If any information is not completed in the correct format then there will be some feedback to tell the user that it hasn't worked and indicate why, to encourage them to complete the form properly. This will happen if:
            - Any fields are empty.
            - The email address doesn't contain an @ or . in the correct places. 
        - Once submitted correctly, the user is directed to a message on a new page which will inform them that their details have been recorded and they were successful in subscribing. 
    - If an incorrect url is entered then a 404 error page will display.  

- I can confirm that all pages on this website are responsive and look good on all standard sized screens. 
    - This was achieved by applying several media queries throughout the css stylesheet. 
    - They were tested using:
        - 'Devtools' toolbar in Chrome.
        - 'Am I Responsive' app. 

<h2 id="compatability">Compatability Testing</h2>

- I manually tested that this website and all linked webpages work in both Chrome and Safari web browsers. 
    - Everything worked perfectly on Chrome.
    - Apple music links wont work in Safari - I am unsure why this is.

- I tested the website on several hardware devices and can confirm that the website looks professional and works as intended, I used the following devices for testing:
    - Galaxy S20
    - Iphone 13
    - MacBook Pro

<h2 id="issues">Issues Found</h2>

### Solved Bugs

- On the music page, for the album 'In the Corners of a Sphere-Filled Room', there is no track list as it is an experimental, instrumental piece. Therefore, there was no ordered list to target like the other albums on the page. 
    - Initially I just targetted the p element with the same instruction as the ol elements, (padding-left:650px;) but this just shifted the text to the right, and not alongside the album cover, with the link remaining underneath.
    - I had to use the 'clear: right;' command to get the text to float on the right hand side of the album artwork, which is floating on the left. Then the text was aligned with the rest of the page and the link followed suit. 

- On the music page, for the album 'Songs Known Together, Alone' the 'listen' link is not in the same position as the others. It sits in the middle of the page rather than in the middle of the empty space which sits to the right hand side. This is due to the length of the track list.
    - In order to rectify this, I tried to give the specific button an id and move it across to the right but that didn't work. 
    - A clear value was added to a float attribute to try to resolve this but that also didn't respond. 
    - I eventually decided to create two columns for all the track lists by using flex and setting a fixed height to the ol elements of all the div elements in this page.
    - The link now sits in the same space for all albums and it is clear which button relates to which item. 

### Unfixed Bugs

- On the success and 404 error pages, there is a lot of negative space at the bottom of some of the pages and a gap between the fieldset and the footer on others. 
    - I initially had the height of these pages set to 80vh which worked well on all devices. 
    - However, when I tested this on some of the mobile devices in landscape, the message was too large for the fieldset and spilled over, making some of the message not visible. 
    - I then changed the fieldset to have 'padding-bottom: 20%;' so that there would always be space to fit the message in all screen sizes. 
    - Doing this has resulted in some of the screens having a gap between the fieldset and the bottom margin.

<h2 id="performance">Performance Testing</h2>

### Lighthouse
- I completed an audit through Chrome Devtools using the Lighthouse program. 
- The performance value sometimes varies.
- The results were as follows when last checked-

![Screenshot of Lighthouse results. Performance is amber with a score of 70. Accessability is green with a score of 100. Best Practices is green with a score of 95. SEO is green with a score of 100.][lighthouse]

<h2 id="validation">Code Validation</h2>

### HTML

To validate the html pages on this website, I used the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
- When I first put the html pages through the validator, the following errors presented themselves: 
    - I had applied height and width dimentions for the image and video files in the html pages rather than via the css stylesheet. 
    - I had put an anchor element within a button element when creating links to other pages. I tried this the other way around before realising that a button element was unnecessary and that I could just style the anchor element to appear like a button, in the css stylesheet.
- All errors have been rectified and all the html pages now pass through the validator. 

### CSS

- No errors were returned when passing through the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
